# Deployment

This document describes how to deploy the Happy backend (`packages/happy-server`) and the infrastructure it expects.

## Runtime overview
- **App server:** Node.js running `tsx ./sources/main.ts` (Fastify + Socket.IO).
- **Database:** Postgres via Prisma.
- **Cache:** Redis (currently used for connectivity and future expansion).
- **Object storage:** S3-compatible storage for user-uploaded assets (MinIO works).
- **Metrics:** Optional Prometheus `/metrics` server on a separate port.

## Required services
1. **Postgres**
   - Required for all persisted data.
   - Configure via `DATABASE_URL`.

2. **Redis**
   - Required by startup (`redis.ping()` is called).
   - Configure via `REDIS_URL`.
   - Managed by this repo: `packages/happy-server/deploy/happy-redis.yaml` (StatefulSet + redis-exporter sidecar).

3. **S3-compatible storage**
   - Used for avatars and other uploaded assets.
   - Configure via `S3_HOST`, `S3_PORT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`, `S3_USE_SSL`.
   - **Deployed separately** — not managed by this repo's Kubernetes manifests. In prod, the S3-compatible service (MinIO or similar) behind `S3_PUBLIC_URL` is provisioned and managed by external infrastructure. The app only consumes it via env vars: `S3_PUBLIC_URL` is set in the Deployment, and credentials come from Vault via ExternalSecret (`/handy-files`).
   - If `S3_HOST` is unset, the server falls back to local filesystem storage (`./data/files/`).
   - For local k8s dev, a MinIO pod is deployed via `deploy/overlays/local/minio.yaml`.

## Environment variables
**Required**
- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres connection string.
- `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET`: master key for auth tokens and server-side encryption.
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string.
- `S3_HOST`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`: object storage config.

**Common**
- `PORT`: API server port (default `3005`).
- `METRICS_ENABLED`: set to `false` to disable metrics server.
- `METRICS_PORT`: metrics server port (default `9090`).
- `S3_PORT`: optional S3 port.
- `S3_USE_SSL`: `true`/`false` (default `true`).

**Optional integrations** (all off unless configured; setting only part of a group is a startup error)
- Clients read `GET /v1/features` (authenticated) → `{ voice, githubConnect, push }` and hide what is off.
- GitHub connect: set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL` together to register the `/v1/connect/github/*` routes. The OAuth callback returns to `WEBAPP_URL`.
  - The GitHub App settings `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` only initialize webhook handling.
- Voice: set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID` together to register `/v1/voice/*`.
  - The agent id is server configuration; apps do not carry one.
  - Voice is available to every signed-in user. There are no subscriptions.
  - Optional `VOICE_MONTHLY_LIMIT_MINUTES` caps each user over the rolling 30 days ElevenLabs reports. Unset means no cap.
- Push notifications: Expo push, on by default; `PUSH_ENABLED=false` turns it off. Pushes are content-free: a fixed title per event (`It's ready!`, `Permission request`, `Clarification needed`), the body `Open the session to continue.`, and data `{ sessionId, kind, url }`. Client-supplied text is ignored. Delivery to your own app builds needs your EAS project, APNs key and FCM credentials.
  - CLI releases before this fork (e.g. `happy notify`) could send pushes directly to Expo using tokens from `GET /v1/push-tokens`; deploy only this fork's clients.
- Debug logging: `DANGEROUSLY_LOG_TO_SERVER_FOR_AI_AUTO_DEBUGGING` (enables file logging + dev log endpoint).

## Docker image
A production Dockerfile is provided at `Dockerfile.server`.

Key notes:
- The server defaults to port `3005` (set `PORT` explicitly in container environments).
- The image includes FFmpeg and Python for media processing.

## Kubernetes manifests
Example manifests live in `packages/happy-server/deploy`:
- `handy.yaml`: Deployment + Service + ExternalSecrets for the server.
- `happy-redis.yaml`: Redis StatefulSet + Service + ConfigMap.

The deployment config expects:
- Prometheus scraping annotations on port `9090`.
- A secret named `handy-secrets` populated by ExternalSecrets.
- A service mapping port `3000` to container port `3005`.

## Production deployment order

The `Lab_HappyServer` TeamCity build runs Build, Push, and its private Deploy
recipe in order. The recipe runs `prisma migrate deploy` in a one-off
Kubernetes Job using the new image and `handy-secrets`, then applies
`handy.yaml` and waits for the rollout. A failed migration exits before apply.

GitHub CI continues to apply migrations to its disposable Postgres database.
Production migrations run before the rolling update, so they must remain
compatible with the currently running release; destructive changes require an
expand/contract deployment.

## Local dev helpers
The server package includes scripts for local infrastructure:
- `pnpm --filter happy-server db` (Postgres in Docker)
- `pnpm --filter happy-server redis`
- `pnpm --filter happy-server s3` + `s3:init`

Use `.env`/`.env.dev` to load local settings when running `pnpm --filter happy-server dev`.
